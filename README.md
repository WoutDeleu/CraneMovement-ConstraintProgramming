### Crane Yard Scheduling Problem 🏗️

Welcome to the Crane Yard Scheduling Problem repository, developed for the Optimization course at KU Leuven. This Minizinc-based project addresses the challenge of planning crane movements in a harbor's craneyard efficiently.

🌐 **Problem Overview**
The goal of this project is to find an optimal schedule for crane movements in a craneyard. This involves determining the order in which containers are picked up and transported, minimizing turnaround times and maximizing efficiency.

Feel free to experiment with different instances and parameters to explore the efficiency of craneyard scheduling.
